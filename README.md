1) Motor Operating Curve: Overview:
This MATLAB script is designed to analyze and visualize the characteristics of different types of electric motors under various load conditions. The code plots the speed-torque curves for synchronous, shunt, and series motors, and compares them against different types of loads including gravity, viscous friction, dry friction, and turbulence loads. This tool is invaluable for students, educators, and professionals in electrical and electronics engineering, particularly those specializing in electric motors.

Code Functionality:

Two example parameters are set: w0 (constant speed for a synchronous motor) and k (a constant used in motor/load characteristics). These parameters are adjustable to fit different motor models.
Load Functions:

Four types of load functions are defined:
load_gravity: Represents a constant load, typical in gravity-dominated scenarios.
load_viscous: Models a viscous load, proportional to the square root of torque.
load_dry: An example of a constant load, representing dry friction.
load_turbulence: Simulates a load for turbulence, proportional to the square of torque.
Motor Characteristics Functions:

Three motor types are modeled:

Plotting:

The script plots the speed-torque curves for each motor and load type. Different colors and styles are used for clarity.
The x-axis represents torque, and the y-axis represents speed.
The plot includes labels, a title, and a grid for better readability.
Operating Point Analysis:

While the script visualizes the motor and load characteristics, finding the exact operating point (where the motor and load curves intersect) would require additional analytical or numerical methods, which can be implemented as an extension of this script.
